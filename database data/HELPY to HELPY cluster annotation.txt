Product partitions in Triton X-114 phase of detergent fractionated organisms, consistent with a cell-associated lipoprotein encoding an otherwise hydrophilic sequence. Product is also defined by peptide mass mapping using mass spectrometry. Tandem repeat sequence occurs in the ORF. Tandem nucleotide repeats of TA occur 5' of the ORF in a putative promoter region; this tract is possibly subject to dinucleotide indels governing phase variable expression of the gene. The vmcA gene is located in the same genomic position relative to upstream conserved adjacent housekeeping genes as the vmm gene in M.  mycoides SC	transcript_id=ENSFCAT00000002877	transcript_id=ENSOGAT00000011963	transcript_id=ENSSTOT00000002463	conserved hypothetical protein hypothetical protein	transcript_id=ENSMLUT00000000135	conserved hypothetical protein	predicted protein	Lodderomyces elongisporus (LELG_03349.1) hypothetical protein (translation)	predicted protein	Putative uncharacterized protein	Putative uncharacterized protein	conserved hypothetical protein KEGG: sav:SAV1738 hypothetical protein	hypothetical protein	jgi|Helro1|172494	Saccharopine dehydrogenase	jgi|Lotgi1|110705|e_gw1.12.231.1	Putative uncharacterized protein

The aligned region is approximately 100 amino acids long.  Tigrfam: TIGR00090 iojap-related protein. This model describes a strictly bacterial family of proteins related to iojap from plants. The gene iojap is a pattern-striping gene in maize, reflecting a chloroplast development defect in some cells. Maize has two RNA polymerases in plastids,but the plastid-encoded one,
