PLD hydrolyzes the terminal phosphodiester bond of phospholipids to phosphatidic acid and a hydrophilic constituent. Phosphatidic acid is a compound that is heavily involved in signal transduction. The common features of the family members are that they can bind to a phosphodiester moiety, and that most of these enzymes are active as bi-lobed monomers or dimers.	endonuclease Nuc	putative endonuclease	putative endonuclease	Endonuclease Nuc	Endonuclease Nuc	phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylglycerophosphate/ cardiolipin synthases like enzyme KEGG: pol:Bpro_4968 phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylglycerophosphate/cardiolipin synthases like enzyme	Putative uncharacterized protein	Putative uncharacterized protein	Phospholipase D superfamily protein PLD
